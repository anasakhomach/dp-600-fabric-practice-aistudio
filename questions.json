Instead of saving files as 'Report_v1', 'Report_v2_Final', you have one live version with full history.\n\n### Further Reading\n- [Fabric Git integration overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/intro-to-git-integration)\n- [Configure Git integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-get-started)",

Option A builds a robot to check the last barcode—fast but needs an engineer to fix. Option D gives a student a simple checklist (low-code)—easier to maintain.\n\n### Further Reading\n- [Incremental refresh in Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/lakehouse-incremental-refresh)\n- [Watermark pattern in Data Factory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/tutorial-incremental-copy-portal)",
